# File Sorter

## Introduction

File Sorter is a command-line tool that sorts files by their types. It can be used to easily organize files in a given directory by grouping them into folders based on their file types, such as documents, images, audio files, videos, etc.

File Sorter supports the following file types:

* Documents: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.rtf`
* Spreadsheets: `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`
* Presentations: `.ppt`, `.pptx`
* Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`,`.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`
* Audio: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.acc`, `.flac`
* Video: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.wmv`
* Code: `.py`, `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js` 

By default, File Sorter sorts files in the user's home directory and saves the sorted files in a new folder called "Sorter" in the same directory. However, the user can also specify a different directory to sort and/or exclude certain directories from sorting.

## Usage
To use File Sorter, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash 
python file_sorter.py [-h] [-b BASE] [-d DESTINATION] [-e EXCLUDE] [-p | -c | -m]
```

## Arguments

* `-h, --help`: Show the help message and exit.
* `-b BASE, --base BASE`: Root directory from which to start sorting. Default is the user's home directory.
* `-d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION`: Directory in which files will be sorted. Default is a new folder called "Sorter" in the same directory as the source file.
* `-e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE`:  Directory to be excluded from sorter.
* `-r RECURSIVE, --recursive RECURSIVE`: Wheather or not to sort in subdirectory of base.

* `-p, --print`: Print files found on their type.
* `-c, --copy`: Copy files found and sort them in destination according to type.
* `-m, --move`: Move files found and sort them in destination according to type.

## Examples

To sort files in the user's home directory and print the files found on their type:

```bash
python file_sorter.py -p
```

To sort files in a specific directory and move the files to the new "Sorter" folder:

```bash
python file_sorter.py -b /path/to/directory -m
```

To sort files in a specific directory and copy the files to a different folder:

```bash
python file_sorter.py -b /path/to/directory -d /path/to/destination -c
```

To sort files in a specific directory recursively and copy the files to a different folder:

```bash
python file_sorter.py -b /path/to/directory -d /path/to/destination -r -c 
```

To exclude a directory from sorting:

```bash
python file_sorter.py -e /path/to/excluded/directory -m
```
